# ONLINE INVITATION MAKER

Online invitation maker provides a group of works with interface environments to create an invitation for numerous occasions. 
This web application is intended to be used by anyone that wants to create an invitation for any kind of occasion one might have.
Online invitation preparation system will allow users to design and prepare their own invitation.
Users can change font style, colour, template and can prepare their own custom invitation by using one of many template options we have  provided or with a picture of their own choice as template.
We have made the web application to look visually appealing to the user by using techniques like glassmorphism.
Parts of the web application are designed to be dynamic considering the nature of our project.
It has the necessary functions to further share the invitation through mail or download it and we also provide options to the user like applying image filers to the template.
We hope you would like our work!
